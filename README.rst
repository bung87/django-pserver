django-pserver
==============

This is a drop-in replacement for Django's runserver command for the impatient.

Django's development server restarts itself whenever it detects a change in any loaded module, which is great.
What's not so great is that during the restart, there is a window of time where, if you're like me, you'd be hitting Ctrl+R key repeatedly on the browser only to be greeted with ``ECONNREFUSED`` because the server is not ready.

Django-pserver solves this problem by reusing the listening socket when it restarts, so you can just hit refresh once and wait (retaining your sanity.)

Usage
-----
To use it, simply add ``pserver`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``, and run ``manage.py runserverp`` with options as usual.


TODO
----
I've tested this on Django 1.2.4 and 1.3, but it could well work with other versions.

> I've made this compatible with Django 1.5, but not tested with < 1.5.

Tested on OS X only, but should work on any UNIX variant. It will probably break horribly on Windows.

> Works like a charm on Linux afaik. And what kind of an idiot uses Django on Windows?
